# Rules

* ___Container naming will always be Stateless Component used for layout and styling, this will help with naming conflicts with actual logic components - Ex. AppHeader component will have a AppHeaderContainer for styles

* classNames for Top Level Styled-Component may become useless

* ComponentNav is container, ComponentNavigation is UL List

* Redux should not bring in base styles for backgrounds and skeleton

* Do best scenerio to not create deep folder structure, utilize index.js files

* Components named StyledAppHeader(Internal) Vs AppHeaderContainer(external)
